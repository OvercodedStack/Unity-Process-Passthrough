# Unity-Process-Passthrough
Unity Process Passthrough is part of CLOVR, which offers a way of calling a process and using it as if it were run by a command line application.  UPP keeps a process handle active and destroying it when no longer required. This package also offers a means of passing and retrieving values from the process when requested.
